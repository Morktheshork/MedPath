                    <p><strong>Rate:</strong> Services are provided at a flat rate of $100.00 per hour.</p>
                    <p><strong>Billing:</strong> Clients are billed after each completed session. Payment is due within
                        thirty (30) calendar days of the session date.</p>

                    <h3>Accepted Payment Methods</h3>

                    <p><strong>Late Payment:</strong> Failure to remit payment within the thirty-day period may result

                    <h2>Scheduling & Availability</h2>
                    <p><strong>Session Duration:</strong> All tutoring sessions are scheduled in one-hour increments.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Standard Availability</h3>
                    <p>Sessions are typically available during the following hours:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Monday through Friday: 5:00 PM - 9:00 PM</li>
                        <li>Weekend sessions: Available on a limited basis depending on tutor availability</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Scheduling Authority:</strong> All scheduling is managed by the Head Tutor, who maintains
                        authority over availability, time slot allocation, and scheduling modifications. Clients should
                        direct all scheduling requests through the designated booking system or directly to the Head
                        Tutor.</p>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Cancellation Policy</h2>
                    <p>We understand that scheduling conflicts arise and accommodate reasonable cancellation requests.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong>Standard Cancellations:</strong> Clients may cancel scheduled sessions without penalty,
                        provided notice is given.</p>

                    <p><strong>Repeated Cancellations:</strong> After three (3) consecutive cancellations by the same
                        client, a cancellation fee may be assessed at the discretion of the service provider. This
                        policy is in place to ensure fair access to limited appointment slots and to respect tutor
                        availability.</p>

                    <p>We encourage clients to reschedule rather than cancel whenever possible to maintain continuity in
                        preparation.</p>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>No-Show Policy</h2>
                    <p>A "no-show" is defined as failure to attend a scheduled session without providing prior notice to
                        the tutor.</p>

                    <p><strong>Enforcement:</strong> No-show occurrences are not tolerated, as they represent a
                        significant disruption to scheduling and tutor time management.</p>

                    <p><strong>Consequences:</strong> Two (2) no-show occurrences will result in immediate termination
                        of the client relationship and discontinuation of all services. No exceptions will be made to
                        this policy.</p>

                    <p>This policy ensures fairness to all clients and maintains the professional standards necessary
                        for effective tutoring services.</p>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Service Discretion</h2>
                    <p>MedPath reserves the right to discontinue services to any client if policies outlined in this
                        document are repeatedly violated, if professional boundaries are not respected, or if the
                        tutoring relationship is deemed no longer productive.</p>

                    <p>All decisions regarding service continuation are made at the sole discretion of MedPath and are
                        intended to maintain a professional, respectful environment conducive to student success.</p>

                <div class="policy-section">
                    <h2>Onboarding & Fit Assessment</h2>
                    <p><strong>Initial Consultation:</strong> All prospective clients are offered a complimentary
                        60-minute onboarding consultation to assess needs, goals, and mutual fit.</p>

                    <p><strong>Fit Determination:</strong> Following the consultation, MedPath will determine whether
                        the client's needs align with our tutoring methodology and approach. If deemed a good fit, the
                        client will be invited to schedule paid sessions. If not a suitable match, the client will be
                        informed respectfully and, when appropriate, referred to alternative resources or services
                        better suited to their needs.</p>

                    <p>This process protects both client investment and tutor resources by ensuring alignment before any
                        financial commitment is made.</p>
